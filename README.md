Surrogate Model-Based Explainability Methods for Point Cloud NNs
==============
This work is based on point cloud networks ([this repo](https://github.com/yanx27/Pointnet_Pointnet2_pytorch)) and local surrogate model-based explainability method LIME ([this repo](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime)). Please follow their instructions to build up the environments.

Usage
--------------
After installing LIME, copy the scripts in lime_script/ into lime/ (lime_base will be replaced)
